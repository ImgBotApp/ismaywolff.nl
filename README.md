My personal portfolio, with content fetched from [DatoCMS](https://www.datocms.com/), built and
hosted by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). By far the best, most enjoyable and simple setup I've
used to host my portfolio so far.

## install

* clone this repository and run `npm install`
* create a `./.env` with a token for dato:

```bash
DATO_API_TOKEN=1234
```
