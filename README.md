My personal portfolio, with content fetched from [DatoCMS](https://www.datocms.com/), built and
hosted by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). By far the best, most enjoyable and simple setup I've
used to host my portfolio so far. The previous iterations were a [static site](https://github.com/ismay/ismaywolff.nl/tree/cb13db16c0912976f992846421b4bd966006a0ef) and a [react application](https://github.com/ismay/ismaywolff.nl/tree/6b95401a8e41e4feb5466a3d48cfc0a906dc1ad5).

## install

* clone this repository and run `npm install`
* create a `./.env` with a token for dato:

```bash
DATO_API_TOKEN=1234
```
