    The page you
    '
    re trying to view doesn
    '
    t exist. If you entered the url manually check whether it
    '
    s correct. If you clicked a link then either I made a mistake, or the page just doesn
    '
    t exist yet. Either way, I
    '
    ll get on it, and make sure that it
    '
    s fixed as soon as possible!

    In the meantime, might I interest you in checking out the page with
     
    <Link
      to="/work"
    >
      my work
    </Link>
    ? It
    '
    s brand new and has barely got any miles on it. Well maintained and previously owned by an old webmaster who just kept it on a server in his garage. I even still have the original manual!
