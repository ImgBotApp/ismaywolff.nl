    Oops, that page can't be found!
  </glamorous(h2)>
  <p>
    The page you're trying to view doesn't exist. If you entered the url manually check whether it's correct. If you clicked a link then either I made a mistake, or the page just doesn't exist yet. Either way, I'll get on it, and make sure that it's fixed as soon as possible!

    In the meantime, might I interest you in checking out the page with 
    <glamorous(Link)
      to="/work"
    >
      my work
    </glamorous(Link)>
    ? It's brand new and has barely got any miles on it. Well maintained and previously owned by an old webmaster who just kept it on a server in his garage. I even still have the original manual!
