      <p>
        The page you're trying to view doesn't exist. If you entered the url manually check whether it's correct. If you clicked a link then either I made a mistake, or the page just doesn't exist yet. Either way, I'll get on it, and make sure that it's fixed as soon as possible!

        In the meantime, might I interest you in checking out the page with 
        <InternalLink
          to="/work"
        >
          <a
            href="https://test.com"
          >
            Test
          </a>
        </InternalLink>
        ? It's brand new and has barely got any miles on it. Well maintained and previously owned by an old webmaster who just kept it on a server in his garage. I even still have the original manual!
