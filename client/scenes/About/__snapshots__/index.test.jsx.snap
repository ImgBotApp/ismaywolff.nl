  <p>
    I'm an artist, a social scientist and a programmer. My work is a combination of these fields and an exploration of the most inspiring parts of each discipline. I was born 1983 in Heerde and live and work in Groningen in the Netherlands.

    I've obtained a master in social psychology from the University of Groningen, and a bachelor's degree in fine art from Academie Minerva of Groningen. A lot of my work can be found on
